# ModularRing
ModularRing is a smart ring with a modular design. A Bluetooth transceiver and an IMU is placed inside the ring band. A battery and an interactive module is each placed on one end of the ring band, and is connected with each other through magnet connectors when worn on a finger. A novel wearing method of rings is proposed to support the separated circuity design. Users can then switch the interactive module based on their needs.
